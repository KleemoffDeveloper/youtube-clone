# About

<p>
A large part of this project has been collaboration and teamwork with all of the group members. We opened up a Trello board, communicated about
GitHub commits, and distributed the work between us. It has been a huge learning experience and also quite necessary for the field we're working in.
We are super proud of the work we've done and we hope you enjoy our project!
